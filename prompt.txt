I have a domain adithya-ms.online and VPS at IP 72.60.204.100 both purchased with Hostinger.
I want to have a subdomain rb.adithya-ms.online that binds randomly between 146.190.62.39 and 169.254.169.254, 
i.e all queries to resolve rb.adithya-ms.online need to go to my VPS and this VPS needs to run a DNS server publicly exposed to bind to these IPs
